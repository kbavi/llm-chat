## Installation

1. Create a [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) account and obtain an API token. Replicate allows you to execute on LLM Models remotely.

2. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kbavi/llm-chat.git
   cd llm-chat
   ```

3. **Create the .env file**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Edit the .env file** with appropriate values:

   ```env
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your_replicate_api_token_here>
   
   BACKEND_PORT=3000
   MONGO_PORT=27017
   FLASK_PORT=5050
   LLAMA2_MODEL_PATH=meta/llama-2-7b-chat
   MISTRAL_MODEL_PATH=mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Build and run the Docker containers from the base directory**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The services should now be running:
   - Node.js Backend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Flask Server: `http://localhost:5050`
   - MongoDB: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Redis: `redis://localhost:6379`

3. **Interact with the API** using tools like `curl` or Postman:

```


## Request Flow

1. **Client** sends a request to the **Node.js Backend** to query a model.
2. The **Node.js Backend** forwards the request to the **Flask Server** with the model name, prompt, and conversation ID (if available).
3. The **Flask Server** generates a response using the specified model and updates the conversation history in **Redis**.
4. The **Flask Server** returns the response and updated conversation ID to the **Node.js Backend**.
5. The **Node.js Backend** stores the prompt, response, and conversation ID in **MongoDB** and sends the response back to the **Client**.


### Notes

- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- The Node.js server interacts with the Flask server to process queries and uses MongoDB to store and retrieve conversation history.
- The Flask server uses Redis to store conversation history by conversation ID.
- You can further enhance error handling and validation as needed.

## Possible Improvements

To further enhance and optimize the system, especially for production deployment, consider implementing the following improvements:

### 1. Using LangChain for Memory Management

- **Description**: Integrate LangChain to attach memory to model runs, which will provide better context retention and improved conversation flow.
- **Benefits**:
  - Enhanced context management for more coherent and relevant responses.
  - Ability to handle longer and more complex conversations without losing context.
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate LangChain with the Flask server to manage conversation history.
  - Update the model querying logic to utilize LangChain for context-aware responses.

### 2. User Authentication

- **Description**: Implement user authentication to secure access to the API and manage user-specific conversation history.
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures that only authenticated users can interact with the system.
  - Allows for personalized conversation history and context management per user.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for secure user authentication.
  - Add user management endpoints (registration, login, logout).
  - Associate conversation history in MongoDB and Redis with specific user IDs.

### 3. Use Locally Installed Models

- **Description**: Use locally installed models instead of relying on Replicate API to reduce response latencies and dependency on external services.
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved response times by eliminating network latency to external APIs.
  - Greater control over model versions and configurations.
  - Reduced operational costs associated with API usage.
- **Implementation**:
  - Install and configure Llama2 and Mistral models locally on the server.
  - Update the Flask server to load and run the models locally.
  - Ensure proper resource management (CPU/GPU) for efficient model execution.

### 4. Logging and Monitoring

- **Description**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track system performance, detect issues, and ensure reliable operation.
- **Benefits**:
  - Real-time monitoring of system health and performance.
  - Easier debugging and issue resolution with detailed logs.
  - Enhanced visibility into user interactions and system usage patterns.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use logging frameworks like Winston (Node.js) and Python's logging module.
  - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
  - Set up alerting mechanisms for critical issues and thresholds.

### 5. Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **Description**: Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
- **Benefits**:
  - Protects the system from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.
  - Ensures equitable access for all users.
  - Helps maintain consistent performance under load.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use middleware in Node.js (e.g., express-rate-limit) to limit the number of requests per user/IP.
  - Implement similar rate-limiting mechanisms in the Flask server.

### 6. Scalability and Load Balancing

- **Description**: Design the system to be horizontally scalable and use load balancing to distribute traffic effectively.
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved system capacity and reliability under high load.
  - Enhanced fault tolerance and availability.
  - Ability to scale out as user demand grows.
- **Implementation**:
  - Containerize services using Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes for scalable deployments.
  - Use load balancers (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.
  - Implement auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of running instances based on load.

### 7. Enhanced Security

- **Description**: Implement additional security measures to protect the system and user data.
- **Benefits**:
  - Protects against common security threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
  - Ensures data privacy and integrity.
  - Builds trust with users through robust security practices.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use HTTPS for secure communication.
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
  - Implement security headers and best practices for API security.
  - Regularly perform security audits and vulnerability assessments.

### 8. Improved Error Handling

- **Description**: Enhance error handling to provide meaningful feedback and ensure graceful recovery from failures.
- **Benefits**:
  - Better user experience with clear and informative error messages.
  - Easier debugging and maintenance with detailed error logs.
  - Reduced system downtime and improved reliability.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use centralized error handling middleware in Node.js and Flask.
  - Provide descriptive error messages and HTTP status codes.
  - Implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies for critical operations.

By implementing these improvements, the system will be more robust, secure, and scalable, providing a better experience for users and maintaining high performance under varying loads.
